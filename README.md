Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms, began as a social media platform founded in 2004 quickly evolved into the world's largest social network, boasting nearly three billion users globally as of 2021, with about half of them engaging daily. Facebook operates primarily through revenue from advertisements on its platform, offering free access to users.

Facebook requires users to use real identities to foster genuine connections and interactions. This approach has facilitated personal relationships, information sharing, and business-consumer interactions. Initially launched as "TheFacebook" at Harvard, the platform expanded rapidly to other universities and then globally, reaching significant milestones such as adding the Wall feature in 2004, enabling friends to post on user profiles. By 2005, tagging photos and unlimited photo uploads enhanced user engagement, attracting millions from diverse demographics beyond students.

Despite efforts to improve user controls, privacy remains a contentious issue for Facebook. Commercially, Facebook's influence grew with its expansion beyond students in 2006, facilitating direct consumer engagement and advertising innovations. The company's IPO in 2012 raised $16 billion, marking a significant financial milestone and underlining its market dominance. Strategic acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp expanded its service portfolio, enhancing its market presence. Facebook's impact extends beyond social networking, playing pivotal roles in political movements globally, from U.S. elections to protests in Colombia and Egypt. The platform's API opened opportunities for third-party developers, fostering a robust app ecosystem and generating substantial revenue.

In recent years, Facebook rebranded as Meta Platforms in 2021, signaling a shift towards developing the metaverse—a virtual reality environment promising new interactive possibilities. Facebook/Meta Platforms has evolved from a university-based social network into a global powerhouse, reshaping communication, commerce, and societal interactions.

### Facebook's System Architecture
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 id="facebooks-system-architecture">The Data Model For Social Graph</h2>
<p>
Facebook stores majority, if not all, of users’ data, such as profiles, friends, posts and comments, inside a single giant social graph. There are two elements inside a social graph, nodes and edges. A node represents an entity, such a user, a post, a comment and a location.
An edge represents the relationships between the nodes.
